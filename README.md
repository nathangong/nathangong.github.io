This is a website where I keep all my projects.

## Projects

### My Classes
This is a website I co-created using the Nuxt.js framework where people from my school can keep track of all my classes and homework for the next day. It uses firebase to store user information and the Microsoft Calendar API to receive data about what classes a student has for each day.

### Arcade
This is a site I made using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my freshman exploring computer science class. It is a collection 5 games ranging from atari breakout to two-player snake.
